      <h2> 1. Define Company. </h2>
      <h5> Ans:- company is a voluntary association of many persons for profit with capital divisible into transferable shares with limited liabilities, having corporate body, separate legal entity and a common seal for perpetual succession. </h5>
		<h2>Question 2: Explain any two features of a company</h2>
<h5>Answer:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Legal Entity: A company has a separate legal entity from its owners, allowing it to hold and deal with any property it owns, enter into contracts, open bank accounts, and take legal actions in its own name and capacity.</li>
  <li>Limited Liability: Shareholders in a company have limited liability up to the face value of the shares they hold, meaning they are not responsible for paying the excess claims of creditors if the company's capital is insufficient.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Question 3: What is a public limited company?</h2>
<h5>Answer:</h5>
A public limited company is a type of company that raises capital by issuing shares to the public. According to the Nepal Company Act 2074 (Amended), a public company is one that is not a private company and must have at least seven members with no limitation on the maximum number. The shares of a public limited company are freely transferable.
<h2>Question 4: Write any two privileges of a public company</h2>
<h5>Answer:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to Raise Capital: A public limited company can raise a large amount of capital by issuing shares to the public.</li>
  <li>Transferable Shares: The shares of a public limited company are easily transferable from one person or party to another.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Question 5: Define private company</h2>
<h5>Answer:</h5>
A private company is a type of company that does not issue shares to the public for raising capital. It can be formed with one member, but the maximum number of shareholders cannot exceed 100 and restrictions are placed on the transfer of shares from one shareholder to another.
